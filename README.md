## Description

This is a budget tracker that allows a user to log their income and expenses. The user is able to log enter a name for the transaction, and whether it should be added or subtracted to the total. Once the transaction is entered in, the user will see a line chart with the added transaction along with their past data. This application works offline as well -the user can enter in a transaction offline which will then be stored in IndexedDB, and then populated once the user is online again.

This application utilizes MongoDB, Mongoose, IndexedDB, and Express.
